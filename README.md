# LattePanda Projects

I bought a LattePanda which is a SBC running Win10 and a Leonardo Arduino all in one. I started to look at how I could use it. While I go through the different ways I want to use it I started to write code to drive it. I wanted to keep it all in on eplace so here is the repository.

So far there are lots of details about the electronics and some projects I made. The projects are listed below and can be found in this repository.

Project 1 – Temperature and Humidity via Arduino.

Project 2 – Temperature and Humidity via C# .Net.

Project 3 – Controlling I/O to set signals.

Some of this code has been found on websites and where I know who wrote the original I have noted that the code belongs to them. However some like me just allow other to use the code and do not say who wrote it, if this is you and you want me to note that you wrote it please just let me know.

# LattePanda Projects

I bought a LattePanda which is a SBC running Win10 and a Leonardo Arduino all in one. I started to look at how I could use it. While I go through the different ways I want to use it I started to write code to drive it. I wanted to keep it all in on eplace so here is the repository.

So far there are lots of details about the electronics and some projects I made. The projects are listed below and can be found in this repository.

Project 1 – Temperature and Humidity via Arduino.
Project 2 – Temperature and Humidity via C# .Net.
Project 3 – Controlling I/O to set signals.
